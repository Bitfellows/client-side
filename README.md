## Change Log
  ### 04-24-18
   We came up with the plan. We are going to build an app that a user can use to track bitcoins. We plan to have a home page, user sign up page, and more.
  ### 04-25-18
   We assigned each of us to research a specific part of the app to research. Lina and I spent our time laying out the way the app should look and defining what and how many pages we need. We need a home page, search page, info page main page and exsisting user home page. We also went thru a lot of free media/photo websites and narrowed down a few pics we want to use for the background.
  ### 04-26-18
   We wrote out the scaffold on the whiteboard. We assigned everyone a certain page to work on.
  ### 04-28-18
   We are close to MVP. The team worked on:
   1. We created a login page with a logo which is opening without any javascript code running for login.
   2. We created the overview page. More content needs to be added there.
   3. We created the coin search page. We have the routes working with page js. 
   4. We also created a navigation header after user logs in which will be going across all other views.
   5. We worked on chart js and how to incorporate it in our app. MVP was complete for chart 1, which is the summary of the 4 main coin prices. We are still working on getting the percentage changes to reflect properly.
