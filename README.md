## Change Log
  ### 04-24-18
   We came up with the plan. We are going to build an app that a user can use to track bitcoins. We plan to have a home page, user sign up page, and more.
  ### 04-25-18
   We assigned each of us to research a specific part of the app to research. Lina and I spent our time laying out the way the app should look and defining what and how many pages we need. We need a home page, search page, info page main page and exsisting user home page. We also went thru a lot of free media/photo websites and narrowed down a few pics we want to use for the background.
